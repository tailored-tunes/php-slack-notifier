# How to contribute

Thank you for making our product even better!

> Please make sure that the feature you're about to add is generic and will help
anyone trying to send messages to slack. If it's a modification you really need,
but is custom to your project, please write a decorator around the service
instead of submitting a pull request.

1. Fork the project
2. Make your modifications
3. Create tests for your code
4. Make sure Travis passes
5. Submit a pull request
